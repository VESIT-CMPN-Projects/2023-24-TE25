# Wireless Data Extraction System for Display Panels

Welcome to the Wireless Data Extraction System for Display Panels project! This system focuses on developing a non-invasive and wireless approach to extract data from display panels using state-of-the-art AI techniques.

## Description
The project leverages the You Only Look Once (YOLO) Model for object detection and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) algorithms to analyze text in real-time video streams. It aims to smoothly collect and process video data from cameras and transmit extracted data wirelessly through IoT devices to a central server. This enables remote monitoring, real-time analysis, and quick response to changes without disrupting operations.

## Key Features
- **Object Detection:** Utilizes the YOLO Model for real-time detection of various objects including text, characters, digits, and more.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** Implements OCR algorithms to analyze text within captured images, enabling extraction of valuable data from display panels.
- **Wireless Data Transmission:** Integrates IoT devices to wirelessly transmit extracted data to a central server, facilitating remote monitoring and analysis.
- **Image Processing:** Utilizes OpenCV for image processing in video streams, including blur detection to enhance image quality without causing delays.
- **Evaluation and Monitoring:** Utilizes TensorBoard for YOLO Model evaluation and monitoring, ensuring model performance and accuracy.
